# Introduction #

Use this page to describe how the app will be organized

# Gui #

All gui controls should be contained within a single xml file. An xml file for each device target will be used. e.g. gui-iphone.xml, gui-ipad.xml, gui-android.xml, etc

Use the indexed array of panels and groups to determine what is drawn and when, based on the wbcScene mode.
